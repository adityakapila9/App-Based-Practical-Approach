Overview:->

OOPS Banner App is a simple Java application that displays “OOPS” (Object-Oriented Programming System) in the console. The application evolves through UC1 to UC5:

UC1: Print simple "OOPS" in the console.

UC2: Display "OOPS" in a large banner format using spaces ( ) and stars (*).

UC3: Refactor banner logic into modular functions.

UC4: Store character patterns in a class (inner class approach).

UC5: Store character patterns in a HashMap for easy rendering.

The main purpose of the app is to practice Java OOP concepts and modular programming.


Key Concepts Used:->

Java classes & main method

System.out.println() for console output

String literals & arrays

Loops: for loop, enhanced for-each loop

Static methods & modular code

Java inner classes & constructors

Getter methods & encapsulation

HashMap & StringBuilder

Nested loops & modular display logic

OOP principles: Encapsulation, Modularity, Abstraction, Reusability


Use Cases:->
UC1: Print OOPS to Console

Goal: Print "OOPS" once in the console.
Key Concepts: Class, main method, print statement, string literals, JavaDoc.

UC2: Render OOPS as Banner

Goal: Display "OOPS" in a large banner (7 rows x 9 characters per letter) using *.
Key Concepts: String arrays, String.join(), loops, console output.

UC3: Refactor Banner Logic into Functions

Goal: Modular approach by creating static methods for each letter pattern and printing.
Key Concepts: Static methods, loops, string concatenation, DRY principle, code readability & maintainability.

UC4: Store Character Pattern in a Class

Goal: Use an inner class (BannerCharacter) to encapsulate each letter and its pattern.
Key Concepts: Inner class, constructor, getters, class variables, arrays of objects, OOP principles (Encapsulation, Modularity, Single Responsibility Principle).

UC5: Use Map for Character Patterns and Render via Function

Goal: Store letter patterns in a HashMap and render any word easily.
Key Concepts: HashMap, nested loops, StringBuilder, encapsulation, modularity, reusability.
